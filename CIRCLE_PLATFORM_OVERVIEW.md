# Circle - Privacy-First Decentralized Social Network

Circle is a revolutionary privacy-first social networking platform that redefines how users interact online by putting privacy, security, and user ownership at the core of the experience. Built on cutting-edge blockchain technology and zero-knowledge cryptography, Circle offers a complete alternative to traditional social media platforms that harvest user data and censor content.

## Core Features

**Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification** - Users can prove various attributes without revealing underlying data, including anonymous identity verification, reputation scores, group membership, and balance verification without revealing actual amounts.

**Native Tor Network Integration** - For maximum privacy, Circle integrates with the Tor network, allowing users to route their traffic through multiple encrypted nodes and access the platform even in regions with internet restrictions.

**Burn-After-Reading Messaging** - Ephemeral messaging powered by XMTP where messages automatically delete after being read or after a set time period, ensuring sensitive conversations remain truly private.

**Encrypted File Sharing** - Enterprise-grade file encryption with Lit Protocol, allowing users to upload files with access control conditions based on ETH balance requirements.

**Emergency Killswitch System** - Sophisticated emergency data protection with multiple clearing levels (soft, hard, nuclear) and keyboard shortcuts for instant data protection.

**Private Circles** - Exclusive communities requiring minimum ETH balance for membership, where creators can set custom requirements starting from 0.1 ETH.

**Real Blockchain Integration** - Built on real Ethereum blockchain technology where users can send ETH, DAI, and USDC directly to other users, with real wallet balances and transaction history.

**Crypto-Native Experience** - Every aspect designed for crypto users with real-time wallet statistics, transaction tracking, and support for multiple Ethereum wallets.

## What Makes Circle Unique

Circle is the first social network built like a weapon, combining enterprise-grade privacy technology with familiar social features. Unlike traditional platforms that harvest user data, Circle operates on zero-knowledge principles - no personal data is ever collected, stored, or monetized.

The platform's unique combination of privacy features, social networking, blockchain integration, and token incentives creates a defensible competitive advantage that traditional social networks cannot replicate.

Circle represents the future of social networking - where users own their data, control their experience, and share in the value they create.
